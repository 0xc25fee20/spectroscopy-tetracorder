   specpr       SPECtrum Proucessing Routines
                General spectral analysis, and plotting for publications

   sp_stamp     installs a header in record 1 of a specpr file
                (WARNING: will do this to any file if the size is a multiple

   spprint      Prints the contents of a specpr file

   radtran      Radiative transfer modeling

   spfeatures   Find spectra with with ranges of spectral features

data translation:
   fstospecpr   ASD field spectrometer to specpr format conversion
   asciitosp    ASCII data to specpr format

   The 2017+ version also includes:

   spsetwave    independent program to set the wavelength and resolution pointers
                to a single specpr record.

   spsettitle   independent program to set the title to a spectrum in a
                single specpr record.


Other packages (separate install)

NEW Specpr INSTALLATIONS and upgrades:

   The following is a scipt that will install everything IF the directories
   and permission have been set up properly.

               AAA.INSTALL.specpr+support-progs-linux-upgrade.1.7.sh
                       or the latest version in the distribution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OLD, use the abve.

   If all the directories are set up and environment variable set, then:

        move or copy the tar file with the upgrade to the 
         directory above $SPECPR
        (e.g. $SPECPR is typically something like /src/local/specpr,
         so copy to /src/local/)

        move the current specpr directory to a different name, e.g.

                cd $SPECPR
                cd ..
                mv specpr specpr-old_date
                # untar the new specpr code, e.g.:
                tar xzf specpr.2017-11-09.tar.gz

                # If you want to set the logo, edit:
                vi $SPECPR/src.specpr/logo/set.logo

                cd specpr
                ./AAA.INSTALL.specpr+support-progs-linux-upgrade.1.3.sh
                        or the latest version in the distribution.
