10/22/2013: Wavelength shift in crt plots

            Change the wavelengths in the crt plots with the
                          wavshift=
            keyword.  The shift stays active while in the plot,
            including interactive band analysis, but the shift
            is reset to zero when leaving the plot.  This is useful
            for diagnosing wavelength shifts.

10/17/2013: Wavelength Markers

            You can now have wavelength markers on CRT/LCD plots
            in 6 colors and 9 markers per color.

            wavelength marker 1 = red
            wavelength marker 2 = blue
            wavelength marker 3 = green
            wavelength marker 4 = orange
            wavelength marker 5 = cyan
            wavelength marker 6 = magenta

            Specify wavelength markers with wm#= and the wavelengths.
            Examples:

            wm1= 2.05 3.1   4.26
            wm2= 1.6  3.15  4.25 4.9 5.05
            wm3= 0.43

            The color scheme is the same as for overlays.


10/17/2013: Show the list of overlays or wavelength markers in color
            on the CRT/LCD plot.

            In the plot command window, type:

            show    # the standard menu
            showov  # show overlay info
            showwm  # show wavelength marker info

            redraw  # redraw the plot


02/23-24/2012: New features with color overlays.

            We now have 6 color overlays, each with auto scaling and
            deleted points.

            overlay 1 = red
            overlay 2 = blue
            overlay 3 = green
            overlay 4 = orange
            overlay 5 = cyan
            overlay 6 = magenta

            overlays can be auto scaled in 3 ways (plus not auto scale):

            A  = standard min max auto scale
            A0 = auto scale max, zero stays at zero
            A2 = min, max autoscale but leave 2% of the max-min range as
                 space on the top and bottom.

            Example:
                     ov2=v60V4 A2 d1t5 36 78t82c

            The autoscaling also works with any plot.  For example, compare
            a reference spectrum to a bunch of spectra in a sequence:

            ov1=v60V4 A2
            v62+999 A2

            Overlays can now be turned on and off anywhere and assigned in the
            plot or in the display routine.
            Sometimes you may need to refresh the plot, so type:
            redraw

            In a plot, change the scalling and add deleted points:

            ov1=on A0 d36c
            ov1=on A2 d222c
            ov1=off
            ov1=on N        # no autoscaling

            Overlays also work in the interactive band analysis routine, and
            do continuum removal on all overlays.  The need for sheets of paper
            with plots held up to the light are no longer needed!

            ovlist   will list the overlays anywhere in specpr

            Known bug: the first plot done after entering specpr
            will not autoscale.

	xwd does not work correctly on linux, and sometimes gets extraneous
	data from other windows.  The new program for dumping x-windows is
	import.  Example:

	       import test1.gif
	       import test2.jpg

	Import creates the file format based on the extension, so works much better
	than xwd. 

	Also, a lot of specpr code was fixed to improve portability between
	32-bit and 64-bit machines.  Some variables were not declared
	a specific size (like real instead of real*4) so they would come out
	different sizes on different architectures.  Also, I did some general
	code clean up to prepare for future expansion to larger spectra.
	Please let me know if you encounter any problems. 
		

08/19/2011: On linux to get specpr to flush the buffers when you write
            a spectrum to disk, set the environment variable 
            GFORTRAN_UNBUFFERED_ALL = y
  
            In csh or tcsh. this would be:

            setenv GFORTRAN_UNBUFFERED_ALL  y

            also useful:

            setenv GFORTRAN_ERROR_BACKTRACE y
            setenv GFORTRAN_ERROR_DUMPCORE  n

08/18/2011: Color is now an option for crt plots.

            # Colors are defined as:
            #
            #   black     0
            #   gray      1 
            #   red       2
            #   blue      3
            #   green     4
            #   orange    5
            #   cyan      6
            #   magenta   7
            #   purple    8
            #   brown     9
            #   white    10

            Set line color with capital L in the display, transfer and overlay
            routines.  Example:

            v100V6oL2 V200oL3 V300ol0   \# red, blue and black spectra overlaid

            in the crt plot routine, change line color by specifying L#, where
            number is 0-9.

            defined overlays are:

            overlay 1 = red
            overlay 2 = blue
            overlay 3 = green

            Define an overlay in the main or display, transfer and overlay with:

            ov1=d1804D6
            ov2=u3894U6

            turn overlays on and off with:

            ov1=off
            ov1=on


08/16/2011: Major upgrade to x-window graphics.
		specify -gxterm2 for double size and double resolution
                graphics window.

            Major side effect: old graphics terminal output is broken.

                -gxterm3 makes a triple sizes window, but resolution
                         is still only double.

            original graphics window is 390 x 512 pixels.
            new resolution is 780 x 1024 pixels

            Resizing the window by hand scales the plot size and resolution,
            If the window is greater than 780 x 1024 pixels, scaling still occurs,
            but resolution does not increase.  (It would not be hard
            to increase real resolution further.)

08/16/2011: Added x-axis offset in plotting routines.

            e.g.:
		v1804 V6 Cp0l3 x-0.5

circa 2005?: Added data offset and multipliers to plot routines

            e.g.:
                v1804 V6 Cp0l3 o*0.5 o+0.2

            above multiplies by 0.5 then adds 0.2

11/27/2001: added x-window plot refresh after bringing window
            to foreground!

09/16/2001: added shoulderness parameters to interactive band
            analysis.

07/19/2000: added readout to the interactive band analysis routines:
            continuum channels, continuum wavelengths, and
            continuum ratios.

10/7/96: dspecpr: major addition to f17 convolution.  F17 now has
         lower limit to the bandpass in the computation.  The default
         is now 1x10^-7, any gaussian or filter value below this
         value will be ignored in the computation.  The typical speedup
         is a factor of 3 compute time.  Also a "s" to suppress
         some warnings was added.  Also added code to use the dates
         and times of data acquisition from the input spectrum on the
         output spectra.

7/11/95: Recompiled dspecpr.  Dspecpr had a number of bugs generated by
         the optimizing compiler.  The new dspecpr is compiled with
         lower level of optimization, so hopefully the bugs will go
         away.


5/4/94:  dspecpr:  The copy commands to a file (the >filename command) now
		   checks to see if the file exists and if it does will
		   no longer clobber it.  Specpr will not open it, so
		   you must select another (new) file name.

3/29/94: dspecpr:  New command line feature: suppress user prompts during
                   reading of command files.  The command is:

                            CMD crt verbose=n

		   where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  The C in CMD must be
		   on column 1 and the spaces are required as shown.
		   The integer specifies the level of suppression.  Zero
		   is no suppression, 1 is suppress alias translations,
		   variable substitutions, command line echoing, etc.
		   Higher numbers are application dependent, being
		   defined by the programmer.  As of this writing, only
		   tricorder 2.0 has these defined.  Other specpr
		   routines will be added on an as needed basis.  It
		   turns out that most of the time in executing a specpr
		   command file is due to waiting for screen scrolling,
		   so use of this feature can make command files run
		   hundreds of times faster!

3/29/94: dspecpr:  Errors which occur during reading of a command file
		   now enable a trap which disables further processing
		   from the command file.  This trap occurs only if the
		   routine calls the subroutine "what," so it may not
		   stop exactly when the error occurs (unless that
		   routine has been cleaned up and what called for every
		   error--tricorder should be robust on this issue).  We
		   will add what calls to make this more robust
		   everywhere, but it will be done as other routines are
		   edited for other reasons.  If you have a particular
		   problem, let Roger know.

9/2/93: dspecpr:   In May 1993: Specpr was compiled with the highest level
                   optimization (+O3 +OP4) and found the 3dio read 
                   routines and the fft subroutine had parts
                   optimized away and they no longer worked.  These
                   routines have been recompiled without full optimization
                   and should be fine now.

8/19/93: dspecpr:  changed division routine to set normalization
                   constants to 1.0 when they become nearly zero
                   (10**-36).  Warning messages will appear when
                   this happens.  This is to prevent crashes
                   on floating underflows or overflows.

2/25/93: dspecpr: compiled on an HP700 and the compiler identifed
		   numerous warnings, like unitialized variables (turns
		   out some were misspelled).  So all were corrected.
		   Hopefully there are no side effects.  One of note:
		   multiplication, division, and subtraction using a
		   constant and error bars didn't appear like the code
		   would do the right thing.  It should now, if it
		   didn't before.  I also added some screen erase
                   stuff for X-windows, like after crt plot scale change.
                   The overlay plot routines now put the file id's
		   in the plot window, and the vertical axis numbers are
		   right justified.  In x-window mode, extraneous alpha
		   window text is erased so things should be less
                   confusing when doing crt plots.

10/5/92: dspecpr only: The x,y positions in hp pen plotter
                        text positions is now in centimeters.
                        No need to scale by 1.025 and 0.79.

9/4/91:  dspecpr only: The graphics mode can now be specified on
         the command line when going a restart.  The command is:

                 dspecpr restart_file -g"graphics_type"

         where graphics type is -gxhp   = X-windows hpterm
                                -gxterm = X-windows xterm
                                -g4     = hp graphics terminal normal
                                -g#     = # = graphics mode number
                                              (see specpr manual)

         For example, run dspecpr, restart file r1 graphics type
         X-windows, hpterm, skip the startup messages:

                     dspecpr r1 -gxhp -

1/24/91: dspecpr only: the wavenumber mode on crt plot is not fixed
         (caused by the X-windows conversion).

8/23/90: (dspecpr only) Addition has undergone major surgery.
         The error bars now give exactly the right results if error
         bars were already included (they were off s few percent when adding
         a few data sets together; the error in the errors decreases with
         more data sets).  The user interface has been streamlined.

8/23/90: (dspecpr only) Variable parsing is complete.  The ascii
         characters "{" and "}" now delimit variable parsing.  You can read
         specpr internal variables (like the file protections) or set your
         own.  Variables ia through iz are user settable integers and ra
         through rz are user settable real variables.

8/23/90: (dspecpr only) X-windows support is now complete.  From an
         X-display system, start specpr in an hpterm or xterm window and set
         the graphics type to g50 (hpterm) or g51 (xterm).  You will have to
         do this each time you enter specpr, even with a restart file.

3/27/90: The hardcopy plot routines can now offset the data.
         Use a "o" and the offset.  Example:

                      v24V22Cp0l3o0.5
                      v23V22Cp0l3

         would offset v24 by 0.5 data units.  Note that because v24
         will (usually) come out above v23, plot it first so the title at the
         bottom of the plot will come out on top.  That way it makes it asier
         to figure out which title goes with the proper curve.

3/13/90: f20 has an addition for reading files: you can select how
         often you want the input data stream to be printed on the terminal.
         On long files, the read is greatly speeded up.  For example, a 4000
         point spectrum takes about 4 minutes when every data point is
         printed, but less than about 10 seconds if you print only every
         100th line!

11/8/89: Changed file assignments to check if a file exists or not.
         If the file exists, a message is printed that says the file
         is being opened, and another when the open is successful.
         If the file does NOT exist, a message is printed that says
         the file does not exist and asks if you want to create it.
         To create the file, you must type y.  If you type any other
         character, the file will not be created.

         This addition will prevent users from creating duplicate
         files in other directories.  At least if you are expecting to
         assign an existing file and it says it doesn't exist, you have
         the chance to not create it.

11/9/89: Added math function 50.  This function registers the
	 wavelengths of a file to those in a reference spectrum.
	 That is, for a given absorption feature, the actual
	 wavelength is chosen from a reference spectrum, and the channel
	 number is taken from the file that is being adjusted.  The actual
	 wavelength is assigned to that channel.  Wavelengths in
	 between features are assigned by a linear interpolation.


11/9/89: BLOCK EXTRACTION ROUTINE

	 Path:		/usr/src/cmd/specpr/3dio
	 Programmer:	Barry J. Middlebrook
	 Description:
	 The subroutine blkext.r (block extraction) is now a working,
	 although not completely tested, part of dspecpr.  The entry
	 point to this routine is a branch under the DISPLAY and OVERLAP
	 (or t option from the main menu) section of dspecpr.  It can be
	 accessed correctly only after assigning a 3-d data file to one
	 of the appropriate letters (v,u,w,y).  Once this criteria is met
	 (and the user indicates a block extraction) the subroutine 
	 calculates the coordinates of the block to be extracted.  From
	 this point, the multiple extractions are executed in exactly the
	 same manner as a single extraction except that certain arrays
	 accumulate the sum, squared sum and a count of the number of
	 elements comprising the sum.  Once the block extraction has
	 terminated these are used to calculate the block average (data
	 array) and standard deviation (error array).  For further
	 information read /u/bmiddleb/notes/DOC/blkext.doc .


1/30/90: 3DIO BUG FIX (Barry J. Middlebrook)

         While working on the band depth mapping routines I noticed
         that the coordinates were squeexed - x appeared as the
         vertical axis and y as the vertical.  I have now fixed that
         to correspond to a more conventional coordinate system 
         (instead of the programmer's perspective).  x is now the 
         horizontal axis and y is now the vertical axis.  Better?
