Researchers at the Spectroscopy Lab have measured the spectral
reflectance of hundreds of materials in the lab, and have compiled a
<b>spectral library</b>.  The library is used as a reference for
material identification in remote sensing images.
This web page provides links to the splib06* series of spectral library
data and supporting information.

<P>
The following links to the Data Series 231 report and includes the description
of how spectra were measured, sample purity, full sample
descriptions, plots of the spectra, and ASCII listings of all data.

The following URL links to the digital data, including native spectrometer data,
interpolated spectra, and convolved instrument spectral libraries.  These data
are dynamic and new interpolations and convolutions are computed as flight instruments
change.  As new information on sample purity becomes available, the sample
documentation will be dynamically updated.
