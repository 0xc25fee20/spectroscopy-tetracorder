<A NAME="intro">
<B>Introduction</B>
</A>

<P>
We have assembled a digital reflectance spectral library that
covers the wavelength range from the ultraviolet to far infrared along with
sample documentation.  The library includes samples of minerals, rocks,
soils, physically constructed as well as mathematically computed
mixtures, plants, vegetation communities, microorganisms, and man-made
materials.  The samples and spectra collected were assembled for the
purpose of using spectral features for the remote detection of these and
similar materials.

<P>
Analysis of spectroscopic data from laboratory, aircraft, and
spacecraft instrumentation requires a knowledge base.  The spectral library
discussed here forms a knowledge base for the spectroscopy of minerals
and related materials of importance to a variety of research programs
being conducted at the U.S. Geological Survey.  Much of this library
grew out of the need for spectra to support imaging spectroscopy studies
of the Earth and planets.  Imaging spectrometers, such as the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Airborne Visible/Infra Red
Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) or the NASA Cassini Visual and Infrared
Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) which is currently orbiting Saturn, have
narrow bandwidths in many contiguous spectral channels that
permit accurate definition of absorption features in spectra from a variety of
materials.  Identification of materials from such data requires a
comprehensive spectral library of minerals, vegetation, man-made
materials, and other subjects in the scene.

<P>
Our research involves the use of the spectral library to identify the
components in a spectrum of an unknown.  Therefore, the quality of the
library must be very good.  However, the quality required in a spectral
library to successfully perform an investigation depends on the
scientific questions to be answered and the type of algorithms to be
used.  For example, to map a mineral using imaging spectroscopy and the
mapping algorithm of Clark and others </I>  (1990a, 2003b), one simply needs a
diagnostic absorption band.  The mapping system uses continuum-removed
reference spectral features fitted to features in observed spectra.
Spectral features for such algorithms can be obtained from a spectrum of
a sample containing large amounts of contaminants, including those that
add other spectral features, as long as the shape of the diagnostic feature
of interest is not modified.  If, however, the data are needed for
radiative transfer models to derive mineral abundances from reflectance
spectra, then completely uncontaminated spectra are required.  This
library contains spectra that span a range of quality, with purity
indicators to flag spectra for (or against) particular uses.

<P>
Acquiring spectral measurements and performing sample characterizations for this
library has taken about 15 person-years of effort.  Software to manage
the library and provide scientific analysis capability is provided
(Clark, 1980, 1993).  A personal computer (PC) reader for the library is
also available (Livo and others, 1993).  The program reads specpr binary files
(Clark, 1980, 1993) and plots spectra.  Another program that reads
the specpr format is written in IDL (Kokaly, 2005).

<P>
In our view, an ideal spectral library consists of samples covering a
very wide range of materials, has large wavelength range with very high
precision, and has enough sample analyses and documentation to establish
the quality of the spectra.  Time and available resources
limit what can be achieved.

<P>
Ideally, for each mineral, the sample analysis would include X-ray
diffraction (XRD), electron microprobe (EM) or X-ray fluorescence (XRF),
and petrographic microscopic analyses.  For some minerals, such as iron
oxides, additional analyses such as Mossbauer would be helpful.  We have
found that to make the basic spectral measurements, provide XRD, EM or
XRF analyses, and microscopic analyses, document the results, and
complete an entry of one spectral library sample, all takes about 1
person-week.  Collecting additional spectra of the same sample (such as, a
grain size series) increases the time by approximately 0.5 day per
spectrum (mostly for sample preparation).  We had hoped that as our experience
increased, this time would decrease, but it has not in our experience
of more than 20 years of developing this and previous spectral databases.

<P>
Vegetation samples and vegetated areas can also have exacting demands
for data collection and documentation.  For leaf samples measured in the
laboratory or field spectra of single plants, basic documentation
requirements include the date of sample collection and measurement and
correct species identification.  Additional documentation is desired on
leaf water and pigment concentrations, requiring the associated laboratory
analysis of those samples.  For field-level measurements of vegetated
areas (vegetation communities), the species in the measured area and
the associated percent cover of each species are desired.  A single plot
can take up to 4 hours to measure, with data reduction, reviewing, and
compiling taking nearly as long.

<P>
This release of this library does not have all samples completely
characterized.  The characterization of samples will continue as our
resources allow, and results will be added in future releases of the
database.  This library, however, contains more extensive sample
documentation and fills in gaps present in the documentation for the
splib05a library (Clark and others, 2003c).  A new component of the
splib06a library is that many samples now include digital photos, as
well as spectra with greater wavelength range.  Some mineral samples
were found to be more contaminated than previous support data indicated,
so some samples have been renamed from earlier versions of the library.
If you cannot find a sample by its name from a previous library, search
by using its sample number. 

<P>
This report describes spectral library 06:  splib06a.  Libraries 01, 02,
and 03 were unpublished experimental exercises that investigated what
to include in a spectral library.  Library 04 (splib04a, Clark and
others, 1993), was our first release.  Clark and others
(splib05a, 2003c), has been our main working library until this release.
The splib06a library includes all spectra from the splib04a and splib05a
libraries with additional documentation derived since publication of
those libraries.



<P>
<A NAME="TOM">
<B>Types of Materials</B>
</A>


<P>
Minerals from arsenate, borate, carbonate, element, halide, hydroxide,
nitrate, oxide, phosphate, silicate (cyclosilicate, inosilicate,
phyllosilicate, nesosilicate, sorosilicate, and tectosilicate), sulfate,
and sulfide classes are represented.  X-ray and chemical analyses are
tabulated for many of the entries, and all samples have been evaluated
for spectral purity.  The library also contains end and intermediate
members for the olivine, garnet, scapolite, montmorillonite, muscovite,
jarosite, and alunite solid-solution series.  We have included
representative spectra of H<sub>2</sub>O ice, kerogen, ammonium-bearing
minerals, rare earth oxides, desert varnish coatings, kaolinite
crystallinity series, kaolinite-smectite series, zeolite series, and an
extensive evaporite series.

<P>
Because of the importance of vegetation to terrestrial studies, we have
included spectra of trees, shrubs, grasses, flowers, leaves, and lichens and
other microorganisms.  Also included are vegetation community spectra.
Laboratory spectra of leaves from a single plant and field spectra of a
single species, or of a plant in its entirety, are listed by the common
name of the species.  Scientific names of vegetation are given in the
supporting documentation.  Field and AVIRIS spectra of vegetation
communities are listed by the dominant species (for example, lodgepole pine), or
by biome (such as grassland or shrubland), or by a land-use term (such as
rangeland).  The vegetation types are representative of the types that we
have encountered and studied in our published works.

<P>
Terrestrial remote sensing also encounters man-made
materials, so we have included spectra of plastics, roofing materials,
processed wood, paint, and other man-made materials.  Spectra of liquids
from water to organic liquids mixed with minerals are also included.
Together, the spectral library encompasses a broad range of materials
that may exist in a remotely sensed image.

<P>
In some cases, several spectra were measured to provided a series that
spans a compositional solid-solution series or a grain-size series or
both.  We tried to include spectra of all mineral classes, particularly
those important to hyperspectral remote sensing.  In other cases,
we have studied particular solid-solution series because we are mapping
them in the field with imaging spectroscopy or studying that mineral in
detail.  This explains, for example, why there are so many alunite,
olivine, and topaz samples in the database.  Future releases of the
database will probably include additional spectra of other solid-solution series.

<P>
<A NAME="SLCO">
<B>Spectral Library Chapter Organization</B>
</A>

<P>
The digital spectral library splib06a is organized in chapters:

<ul>
<li> Chapter 1: M = Minerals
<li> Chapter 2: S = Soils, Rocks, and Mixtures (except those with vegetation)
<li> Chapter 3: C = Coatings
<li> Chapter 4: L = Liquids, Liquid Mixtures, Water, Other Volatiles, and Frozen Volatiles
<li> Chapter 5: A = Artificial (Man Made) Including Manufactured Chemicals
<li> Chapter 6: V = Plants, Vegetation Communities, Mixtures with
                    Vegetation, and Microorganisms
</ul>

<P>
The placing of some samples into a particular chapter was not always
clear cut.  For example, pure minerals are often difficult to find, or
it may be difficult to process the sample to purify the mineral.  Such a
sample could be considered a mixture.  We placed some samples of this
type in the minerals chapter (Chapter 1:  M) because we are using the
sample and its spectra to match to pure minerals.  We tended to place in
the mixture chapter (Chapter 2:  S) spectra of samples that show
specific spectral properties of mixtures that we use for identification
and mapping of those mixtures.  Usually these include overlapping
absorption features.


<P>
<A NAME="spectr">
<B>Spectrometers</B>
</A>

<P>
The spectra in our library were measured on at least one of four different
spectrometers:  (1) a Beckman 5270 covering the spectral range 0.2 to 3
&#181;m (micrometers), (2) an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) portable field
spectrometer covering the range from 0.35 to 2.5 &#181;m, (3) a Nicolet
Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Interferometer Spectrometer covering
the range from about 1.3 to 150 &#181;m, and (4) the NASA Airborne
Visible/Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer AVIRIS, covering the range 0.4
to 2.5 &#181;m.  The spectral resolution of these instruments is shown
in figure 1.

<P>
Spectra run on our modified Beckman 5270 spectrometer from 0.2 to 3.0
&#181;m were corrected to absolute reflectance.  This instrument
measures directional-conical light as described in Clark and others
(1990b).  Samples were run with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 500
at a reference reflectance level of 1.0.  A few minerals were also run
over a slightly smaller wavelength range because of sample size
limitations.  For example, small sample quantities, necessary for
purity, were measured by using apertures in the beam to restrict the
spot size of the spectrometer.  This reduced light made integration
times longer, and the achievable range was sometimes reduced, typically
to 0.3 to 2.7 &micro;m.  In some cases, this also limited the
signal-to-noise ratio that was achievable.  It is not possible with the
current Beckman instrumentation to substantially improve the spectral data on
small volume samples.  The ice sample, measured at 77 Kelvin, only
includes the infrared range, 0.8 to 3.0 &micro;m.

<P>
Spectra measured on the ASD spectrometer used a directional light source
and fiber-optic probe to collect light.  The incidence angle was
variable but typically ranged from 20 to 40 degrees, as did the emission
angle.  Spectra are corrected to absolute reflectance by using a Spectralon
standard with correction methods similar to that described in Clark 
and others (1990b).  Field spectra measured using the ASD spectrometer
have been collected under various sky conditions.  Most are collected
under optimum conditions of clear skies and within an hour of noon.
Because of limited time for field work, some spectra have been collected
under partly cloudy skies and up to 3 hours before or after solar noon.

<P>
Spectra were also run on a commercial Nicolet Fourier Transform
Infra-Red (FTIR) interferometer spectrometer.  Most spectra were run on
a Nicolet model 740 until 1998 when spectra were run on a Nicolet
Magna-IR 760 spectrometer.  Spectra were measured over a range from
about 1.3 to 150 &#181;m.  To cover the factor of 100 in wavelength
range from 1.5 to 150 &#181;m, two detectors (some samples used three
detectors) and two beam splitters had to be used.  For all samples, the
near IR (1.3 to 5 &#181;m, referred to here as the NIR) and the mid-IR
(~2.5 to 25 &#181;m, MIR) were measured with the same beam splitter and
with no change in the sample.  On the Nicolet 740, only a change in
light source was required:  a simple change of a lever.  On the Nicolet
Magna, an internal mirror automatically switched the light source and
detector.  With some setup changes in an instrument or between
instruments, a wavelength region was measured at a different time; thus,
each sample was put back in its bottle between measurements.  There was
sufficient overlap in the data to confirm consistency across the
spectral boundary.

<P>
The AVIRIS spectra in this library are of samples where it would be
difficult to make measurements with normal field portable spectrometers,
such as tall trees (requiring cranes or other means to lift the
spectrometer and operator above the sample).  Calibration of AVIRIS data
is discussed in Clark and others (2003a).

<P>
<A NAME="sampnam">
<B>Sample Naming</B>
</A>
<P>
The name for each sample occurs in three places: (1) in the specpr (Clark,
1993) title field for the spectrum, (2) in the specpr title field for the
description entry, and (3) after the keyword in the description.  We have
tried to use only proper mineral names as given in Fleischer (1980),
Fleischer and Mandarino (1995), and Klein and Hurlbut (1999).  Some
users of the library may be unfamiliar with all the mineral names.  For
example, if you want to find all scapolites, you would have to know that
dipyre is a scapolite if you only looked at the specpr title fields.
Because of the 40-character limit in a specpr title field, we could not
include all common names there; however, we used the keywords
(described below) in the description for each sample.  Here you could
search for scapolite and find all entries in the "scapolite
group" (dipyre, marialite, meionite, and mizzonite).

<P>
We have used specific mineral names except in a few cases where we still
do not have sufficient data.  For example, in the database, we avoid
the general term "hornblende" where possible, instead using names
like ferro-hornblende and magnesio-hornblende, which due
to space limitation we call Hornblende_Fe and Hornblende_Mg
respectively.  We do have two samples where we cannot make the distinction,
so they are labeled hornblende (samples HS16.3B and HS177.3B).

<P>
The specpr title field is limited to 40 characters.  Some sample names,
especially mixtures, are too long to fit in this space; thus, names are abbreviated.
The abbreviations used in this library are listed here: 
<A target="_blank" HREF="abbreviations.asc"> click here. </A>



<P>
<A NAME="sampdoc">
<B>Sample Documentation</B>
</A>

<P>
Each spectrum has a sample description page describing the origin
and sample purity from available data.  The sample description pages
follow those from Clark and others (1993, 2003c) with keyword=value
or keyword followed by text and end_keyword.  The description
pages are in html format.  The html format still contains the
keyword organization.  Different sample types have different documentation
formats.  For example, minerals require some different documentation
from plants.

<P>

</ul>

<P>
Every entry in the description pages is not complete for every sample.
Thus, the description pages reflect the growing and evolving 
state of a dynamic spectral library.


<P>
This spectral library includes an updated set of sample description
pages that also apply to the Clark and others (1993, 2003c) libraries.  Many
new X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses have been completed, so most
mineral samples now have XRD data.

<P>
<A NAME="digphoto">
<B> Digital Photographs </B>
</A>

<P>
Many samples now include digital photographs.  For minerals, all digital photos
are at a scale of 8 &#181;m per pixel.  For the splib06a library, these photos
were obtained in the laboratory with a 180 mm macro lens on a 6-megapixel
digital camera (a Canon D60).  Photos were obtained in raw mode and included
in splib06a as jpeg conversions from the raw data with no manipulation.
The photos were obtained with standard meter settings using a spectralon
reflectance target, the same reference surface used for the ASD field spectrometer
reflectance calibration.  By using one reference target, intensities can be
compared between samples.  In a future release, the raw camera data may
be reduced to produce 16-bit tif reflectance calibrated images.

<P>
The digital photos of vegetation are field photos and are at various
scales.



<P>
<A NAME="SPSRF">
<B>Spectral Purity and Spectral Range Flags </B>  
</A>

<P>
Each spectrum has coded into the Specpr title the spectral wavelength
range, the spectral resolution and spectrometer used, and spectral
purity information.  In the Clark and others (1993) spectral
library, the code was:  W1R1Bx.  The "W" stands for "wavelength range"
followed by the wavelength range measured, which is given as
W1-W4 (table 1).  Range W1, for example, is a nominal range of 0.2 to 3.0
&#181;m.  The "R" stands for "resolution" followed by the resolution
index.  For the first version of the spectral library (splib04a), only Resolution 1
of the Beckman spectrometer (R1B) was used.  The "x" is a non-numerical
character (a, b, c, d, ?, or _) describing the spectral purity in the
indicated spectral range and is further defined below.

The wavelength, resolution, and spectrometer codes in this new library
are given in tables 1 and 2 and are more complex to reflect the additional
spectrometers, their resolutions, and wavelength ranges.  In the new
library, B=Beckman spectrometer, F=ASD field spectrometer, N=Nicolet
spectrometer, and A=AVIRIS (Table 2).  Two additional spectral range
numbers are used:  W5, consisting of W2 + W3, and W9, consisting of
ranges W2 + W3 + W4.  Three additional spectrometers are listed, where
F=ASD field spectrometer, N=Nicolet spectrometer, and A=AVIRIS (table 2).
Additional purity codes may also be used depending on the number of
spectral ranges measured.  For example, W9 has three spectral ranges,
hence three spectral purity codes listed in increasing wavelength order.

</ul>


<P>
For this release, splib06a, some spectra have all spectral regions
measured and evaluated. 

<P>
Spectral purity codes are defined below:


<P>
<B>a</B>:  The spectrum and sample are pure based on
significant supporting data available to the authors.  The sample purity
from other methods (for example, XRD, microscopic examination) indicates
essentially no other contaminants.  Spectrally, no contaminants are seen
in the spectrum.


<P>
<B>b</B>:  The spectrum appears spectrally pure.  However,
other sample analyses indicate the presence of other minerals that
probably affect the absolute reflectance level to a small degree, but do
not add any significant spectral features in that region.  The spectral
features of the primary minerals may be slightly less intense, but the
feature positions and shapes should be representative.  For example, in
the visible-NIR wavelength regions (W1 or W2), quartz would tend to
increase the reflectance level and decrease absorption band strength
but would not add any measurable features to the spectrum.  Such a
sample would rate a "b."  In a few cases, where we have little support
data but the spectra for that mineral are well known, we assigned the
spectral purity based on the spectral data, possibly along with
information derived from a microscopic examination of the sample.  There
are a few "b" ratings assigned this way.  AVIRIS data of vegetated
areas have been assigned a "b" rating due to the imperfect atmospheric
correction that can be performed on remotely sensed spectra.


<P>
<B>c</B>:  The spectrum is spectrally pure except for some weak features
with depths of a few percent or less caused by other contaminants.  For
example, some minerals may have some slight alteration that is apparent.
Spectroscopic detection of alteration minerals is easier for more
transparent minerals.  For example, some of the albite spectra show weak
2.2-&#181;m features due to alteration.  From the knowledge of the
mineral formula, one can often tell which spectral features do not
belong to the mineral.  Albite, for instance, does not have OH in the
formula, so water or hydroxyl features (1.4, 1.9, and 2.2 &#181;m in the
spectrum) are not due to albite.  However, one could argue that
incipient alteration due to weathering is common in minerals at the
Earth's surface.  Thus, spectral bands due to weathering are somewhat
characteristic of many samples (such as feldspars), even if they are not a
property of the pure mineral.  Spectral features of alteration minerals
might be useful in some cases, but such alteration and their spectral
effects still reduce spectral purity as far as this library is
concerned.  Note, also, that almost every sample has some absorption
near 3 &#181;m due to water in the sample.  Water adsorbs onto mineral
grains and is common.  Water absorptions at 3 &#181;m are not considered
contaminants and do not affect spectral purity.


<P>
<B>d</B>:  Significant spectral contamination.  The spectrum is included
in the library only because it is the best sample of its type currently
available, and because the primary spectral features can still be
recognized (it may also have a better spectral purity in another
wavelength range).  However, the spectrum should be used with care.  The
sample description should be consulted as a guide to which spectral
features are due to the actual mineral.  This sample may be purged
from the database in future releases as better samples become available.


<P>
<B>?</B>:  There are insufficient analyses or
knowledge (or both) of the spectral properties of this material to evaluate its
spectral purity.  In general we have included such samples because we
believe their spectra to be representative.  These are samples for which
we are concentrating future analyses in order to resolve the purity
issue. Note that there may be sufficient
knowledge to assign spectral purity in one spectral region but not
in another.

<P>
<B>_</B>: The spectral range was not measured, but a place holder is included
for the future.

<P>
Mixtures, soils, rocks, and coatings can be spectrally complex.  The
spectral purity of complex mixtures can still be high (assigned "a"
status; see the section on Spectral Purity, if the goal is to
document the spectral features in such a mixture.  Mixtures that have
unintentional contamination have a lower spectral purity than if
contaminants were not present, following the guidelines jus given.

<P>
The spectral purity should be consulted before use of spectra to see if
the sample is appropriate for the intended purpose.  For example,
examination of the spectra for hypersthene PYX02 will show that the
spectral purity is a "c," meaning contaminating spectral features
overlap diagnostic hypersthene spectral features.  However, as
documented in the sample description, the pyroxene sample contains a
small amount of tremolite alteration.  Whereas the tremolite absorptions
are narrow absorptions at 1.4 and 2.3 &#181;m, the pyroxene absorptions
are very broad.  If your spectral analysis can ignore the contaminant's narrow
absorptions, then this sample's spectrum can be used as an excellent reference
spectrum for hypersthene.

<P>
For another example of spectral purity, consider the spectrum of
orthoclase sample NMNH142137.  The spectral purity is a "b."  There are
weak alteration mineral absorptions in the 2 to 2.5 &#181;m spectral
region that are not indicative of feldspars.  Most feldspars for which
we have seen or measured spectra show evidence of alteration to muscovite at 1.4
&#181;m and at 2 to 2.5 &#181;m.  These absorptions are not due to
feldspar and should not be used to identify feldspars.

<P>
The spectrum for each mineral should be evaluated for contaminant features
and how those features might interfere with a particular analysis.
Knowledge of the spectral properties of minerals and other materials is
important in using any spectral database's reference spectra for identifying
other minerals and materials.  See Clark (1999) and references therein
for discussions of spectral properties of materials and principles of
spectroscopy.

<A NAME="SMSE">
<B>Spectral Measurement Side Effects</B>
</A>

<P>
<B>1) Residual Water Absorptions in the Samples.</B>
Even anhydrous minerals show an absorption near 3 &#181;m due to water
adsorbed onto the surfaces of the mineral grains.  Our experience has
shown that these water absorptions are still present, although slightly
weaker in dry nitrogen purged environments.  Consequently, the spectra
measured on the Nicolet in a dry atmosphere will have different
absorption than will those same samples measured by other spectrometers
such as the Beckman in a normal room atmosphere.  Spectra of similar
samples obtained at other facilities - those in Hawaii or on the east
coast of the United States - have shown that the water absorptions in
the spectra from relatively dry Colorado are really quite small in
comparison.  Placing the sample in a dry nitrogen atmosphere or in a
vacuum oven has little effect on the water absorption because water from
the atmosphere will readsorb onto the sample by the time it reaches the
spectrometer.  Experiments at the University of Hawaii have also shown
that most of the adsorbed water remains, even under a strong vacuum at
room temperatures (Clark, 1981).  In general we decided not to heat our
samples in order to avoid any temperature-induced alteration.

<P>
<B>2) Low Signal Artifacts.</B> The Nicolet FTIR near-infrared
measurements have an artifact toward shorter wavelengths.  From
wavelengths of about 2 &#181;m down to 1.3 &#181;m, the reflectance
often decreases giving a convex shape to the spectrum.  This rollover is
not correct.  Attempts to derive a correction have not been successful
because the amount of rollover is variable from sample to sample.  We
include this spectral range because the very high spectral resolution
can be quite useful for studying narrow spectral features.  The rollover
becomes more intense at wavelengths shorter than about 1.5 &#181;m.  We
sometimes include data to 1.3 &#181;m if narrow spectral features are
present, but the broader upward convex curvature should not be
interpreted as spectral structure.


<P>
<B>3) Purged Samples and Residual Atmospheric Features.
</B>All Nicolet samples in this library were measured in a dry nitrogen
atmosphere, scrubbed of H<SUB>2</SUB>O and CO<SUB>2</SUB> by a Balston
air purification system.  The sample and the reflectance standard were
each placed in the sample chamber, and a period of time was allowed to
pass before a measurement was made.  The standard and reference were
each measured at approximately the same time after installation into the
chamber, so the purge and any residual atmospheric gases which could
cause absorptions should be roughly comparable and therefore should
cancel.  This method did not always work perfectly, and residual
atmospheric absorptions (H<SUB>2</SUB>O and CO<SUB>2</SUB>) are
sometimes present at a low level (for example, see Salisbury and others,
1991).  Such residual absorptions (fig.  2A, B) are difficult to remove
completely because of the intense nature of the absorptions.  Similar
features are reported in other databases covering this spectral region
(for example, Salisbury and others , 1991).  For field and AVIRIS spectra of
vegetation, the spectrometer channels that are strongly influenced by
atmospheric absorptions have been set to the deleted point value of
-1.23x10<sup>34</sup>.

<P>
<B>4) Spectral Measurement Geometry.</B> The measurement of reflectance
with our Nicolet spectrometer results in an unusual side effect due to a
small beam size.  The basic geometry of the Nicolet spectrometer
biconical reflectance attachment is shown in figures 3A and 3B.  The
reflectance attachment focuses the spectrometer beam onto a spot about 2
mm in diameter (fig. 3B) via an elliptical mirror.  A second mirror
collects the reflected light and sends it to a detector.  The small spot
size produces side effects at wavelengths where the sample is weakly
absorbing and multiple scattering of reflected photons is a significant
portion of the signal.  Some photons will scatter from grain to grain,
leaving the surface outside the focus of the collection mirror, and
therefore are not seen by the detector (fig. 3B).  This results in a
relative loss in signal and a lower measured reflectance at wavelengths
where multiple scattering is significant.  This phenomenon is
illustrated in figure 4, where a Nicolet measurement is compared to a
spectrum from the Clark and others  (1993) library. In general, the
Nicolet spectra are scaled to match the reflectance measured with the
Beckman and (or) ASD spectrometers at 2.25 &#181;m.  In figure 4 the Nicolet
measurements show weaker 2.16, 1.75, and 2.3 &#181;m absorptions due to
this effect.  The Nicolet measurement is also lower in reflectance at
wavelengths smaller than 2 &#181;m due to this effect.  The
increased spectral structure in the Nicolet spectrum near 2.5 &#181;m is
due to its higher spectral resolution compared to that of the Beckman
spectrometer.

<P>Figure 4.  The sample viewing geometry and small spot size of the
Nicolet spectrometer reflectance attachment (fig. 3) results in some
loss of photons.  Here, a Nicolet measurement is compared to a spectrum
from the Clark and others  (1993) library.  The spectra are scaled to
match at 2.25 &#181;m.  The Nicolet measurements show weaker 2.16, 1.75,
and 2.3 &#181;m absorptions due to the light loss effect.  The Nicolet
measurement is also lower in reflectance at wavelengths smaller than 2
&#181;m due to this effect.  The increased spectral structure in
the Nicolet spectrum near 2.5 &#181;m is due to the much better spectral
resolution compared to that of the Beckman spectrometer.
 


<BR CLEAR=all>


<P>
The narrow focus range of the Nicolet measurement geometry results in large
changes in reflectance level with small changes in the position of the
surface of the sample.  Because of this uncertainty, data from the Clark
and others  (1993, 2003c) visible-near-infrared libraries and
newer spectra were used as a guide to scale the Nicolet to the correct
reflectance levels.  Because of the light loss effect described above,
the reflectance level of samples high in reflectance (greater than about
0.4) in the 1.5-2.5 &#181;m spectral range is accurate only to about
10 percent.  Darker samples should have more accurate reflectance levels.

<P>
Organic materials at low concentrations can leave residual spectral
features (fig.  5).  This usually affects only spectral features in the
region near 3.4 &#181;m.  However, organic compounds can be very
absorbing at other wavelengths, especially in the ultraviolet.  Organic
compounds can darken the spectrum from the ultraviolet to infrared,
lowering reflectance levels.  In reflectance, these effects are nonlinear,
with a small abundance of dark material having a large influence
on reflectance (Clark, 1983, 1999).  Users of the library wanting to
derive optical constants or to conduct other quantitative work should
consult the sample documentation and evaluate the data for what effect
contaminants would have on an analysis.

<B>Wavelength Precision </B>  
</A>

<P>
The wavelength precision of our custom-modified,
computer-controlled Beckman spectrometer was checked using
Holmium Oxide filters in the visible and using the positions of known
mineral absorptions in the near infrared.  In particular, we developed
pyrophyllite as a wavelength standard because of its many narrow
absorptions (Clark and others, 1990b).  The positions of the
absorptions have been checked, using the same pyrophyllite
standard, on three FTIR spectrometers.  In general, the wavelength
accuracy is on the order of 0.0005 &#181;m (0.5 nm) in the near-IR
and 0.0002 &#181;m (0.2 nm) in the visible, always a small fraction
of the spectral resolution.  Wavelength precision for this instrument
is further discussed in Clark and others (1990a).

<P>
The wavelength precision of the ASD portable field spectrometer was
monitored using REE impregnated glass and a mylar plastic sheet with
strong absorption features.  The instrument was also calibrated annually
by the manufacturer.  The position of the mylar spectral features was
precisely measured with our Nicolet FTIR instrument, described next.

<P>
The wavelength precision of a Fourier Transform Spectrometer is
accurate to better than the bandwidth of the system.  The Nicolet FTIR
systems use a red laser wavelength as a fringe counter in the
interferometer, a fraction of the shortest wavelength measured in this
library.  We also confirmed wavelength positions with our pyrophyllite
standard (Clark and others 1990b, 1993) and its many narrow
absorption bands, which were measured using three different
FTIR spectrometers and our Beckman spectrometer and found to be very
consistent.

<P>
The wavelength calibration of the NASA AVIRIS system was performed
by NASA/JPL (Green and others, 1990, 1996).

<A NAME="SPDP">
<B>Spectral Plots and Data Precision </B>
</A>

<P>
Plots of the spectra presented here are limited to one of several
vertical scales (including 0.0 to 0.1, 0.15, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8,
1.0, or 1.1) and use the same horizontal range for easy comparison.  The
overlapping vertical ranges ensure the spectrum is framed well yet
still shows spectral detail, and the range that best shows the spectrum
was selected for each plot.  The error bars are plotted only when they
are above a threshold that allows them to be distinguished on the plot.
Most error bars are too small to be distinguished.  Each plot shows the
specpr title, date and time of acquisition, file name, record number,
and wavelength set.  Not all spectra include error estimates.

<P>
Each spectrum was run with a desired signal-to-noise ratio of at least
500 relative to unity reflectance.  In practice, it would take too long
to obtain such a signal-to-noise ratio in regions where the
signal is low, so an upper limit to the integration time per channel was
also specified with our Beckman spectrometer.  Thus, typically at the
ends of the spectra (both short and long wavelength ends), the precision
drops slightly.  Refer to the error bars for each spectrum or examine
the channel-to-channel noise to determine the precision at a given
wavelength for any individual spectral channel.  The ASD and Nicolet
spectrometers typically have higher signal-to-noise ratios but do not
report error data.  Thus, signal-to-noise ratios must be estimated by the
spectral channel-to-channel variability.



<P>
<A NAME="MMOC">
<B>  Mineral Mixtures and Optical Constants </B>  
</A>


<P>
This spectral library contains pure materials as well as mixtures.
For computing intimate mineral mixtures (such as rocks or soils),
radiative transfer algorithms using the Hapke reflectance model (Hapke,
1981) are part of the specpr package.  To compute mixture or pure
end-member spectra, a set of optical constants are required as a
function of wavelength.  The algorithms use optical constants so that spectra
can be calculated as a function of grain size, abundance in a mixture,
and viewing geometry.  Reflectance spectra of grain-size distributions
can also be simulated by computing a mixture of the same mineral (or
even several minerals) at several grain sizes.

<P>
Pure samples are extremely rare.  Spectroscopy, especially over the
0.2 to 150 &#181;m spectral range (a factor of 750 in wavelength range), is
very sensitive to low-level contaminants at some wavelengths.
Spectroscopy can detect a trace contaminant even in samples ground from
single crystals that appear pure.  Thus, most samples in this library
could be considered  mixtures at some level.  In other cases, deliberate
mixtures are included because of the common associations in which they
occur.  If you intend to use a spectrum for a particular purpose,
confirm the spectral purity to be sure it is appropriate for your needs.

<B>The Digital Data File</B>
</A>

<P>
The digital spectral library data are all included in one file in
<A target="_blank" HREF="specpr-format.html">
"specpr" format </A> (see Clark, 1993).  This file, splib06a, is 51
megabytes in size and has been assembled and managed using the spectral
processing software package, specpr.  The data are in IEEE binary
floating point format.  The entire library is assembled, plotted, and
printed by command files consisting of Unix shell commands, which in
turn generate specpr commands to build the library.

<P>
<A target="_blank" HREF="http://speclab.cr.usgs.gov/specpr.html"> Specpr
</A> runs on Unix workstations.  If the binary file is read on an IBM-PC
compatible machine, the floating point numbers need their bytes swapped
(this is automatically done with the program by Livo and others, 1993).
ASCII versions of all spectra along with plots are presented in the
<B>data table</B> at the end of this Web document.

<P>
The specpr data file can also be read using the "View_SPECPR" ENVI/IDL
software (Kokaly, 2005; see link to URL in reference section).  This
software is a set of IDL programs that can be downloaded and installed
on computers running the commercial ENVI/IDL software.  The View_SPECPR
program allows the user to 1) list the contents of SPECPR spectral
library files, 2) plot and overplot spectra in the library, and 3) view
and print the supporting documentation and photos.

<P>
The organization of the binary data file, in the form of a specpr
listing, is shown in table 3.  The listing shows the record number,
title, length of the data set (number of channels for spectra; number of
bytes for text), and the time and date of data acquisition.  Records
containing the wavelength sets for the spectra and records containing
 the spectral resolution data sets occur one time near the beginning
of the file.  The resolution for each spectrometer is shown in figure 1.
Entries with the keyword "DESCRIPT" are sample description records and
contain all the sample documentation.  After the DESCRIPT are (usually)
two empty records (title ..)  for future expansion of the description.
Next comes the reflectance data, with the keyword AREF, RREF, or RTGC.  The
identifier such as "W1R1Bx" signifies the wavelength range,
resolution, spectrometer, and spectral purity, which was described earlier
(the "x" is a lower case spectral purity letter code).  After the
reflectance record is the "errors to previous data" record.  These are
the standard deviations of the mean for each reflectance value if those
values exist, or otherwise a placeholder of zeros.  The next record in the
listing contains the feature analysis for the spectrum.  This feature
analysis was done using the specpr f45 special function and is described
in Clark (1987) and Clark and others (1993).


<P>
The reflectance type, AREF, RREF, or RTGC, is defined as follows.
AREF is absolute reflectance using standards as described in
Clark and others (1990b).  RREF is relative reflectance.  All Nicolet
spectra used a stainless steel mirror as the standard and are
therefore relative to the reflectance of stainless steel.
RTGC stands for "Radiative Transfer Ground Calibrated," the method
used for all AVIRIS spectra and defined in Clark and others (2003a).

<P>
In the spectral library, any value of -1.23x10<sup>34</sup> is
considered a deleted point.  Because of the inherent floating point
inaccuracies of single precision numbers on various computers, values in
the range -1.23001x10<sup>34</sup> to -1.22999x10<sup>34</sup> should be
considered deleted points.  In the ASCII listings, deleted points are
expressed as a string of asterisks (*).

<P>
The spectral library containing the spectra,
standard deviation error values, sample description pages, and a spectral
feature analysis of each spectrum is compiled in a specpr-format
binary file.  Binary files of the original and instrument-convolved spectral
libraries will be maintained for ftp file transfer from
<A target="_blank" HREF="http://speclab.cr.usgs.gov/spectral-lib.html">
http://speclab.cr.usgs.gov/spectral-lib.html</A>.

<P>
Information describing the samples is stored in the specpr file as
"DESCRIPT" records.  These records contain the sample documentation in
html format and are located in records preceding the spectral data.
The information in these records is described in the sample
documentation section.

<P>
<A NAME="ISL">
<B>  Instrument Spectral Libraries </B>  
</A>

<P>
The intent of the spectral library is to serve as a knowledge base for
spectral analysis.  Comparison of spectral data is best done when the
spectral resolutions of the knowledge base and the spectra undergoing
analysis are identical.  The specpr software (Clark, 1993) has tools for
convolving the spectral library to the resolution and sampling interval
of any instrument.  The native (laboratory) spectral library will also
be convolved to AVIRIS spectral resolution and sampling for the
terrestrial instruments, and to Galileo NIMS, MGS-TES, and Cassini VIMS
for the planetary imaging spectrometer instruments.  Other
instrument-specific spectral libraries will be convolved as the
instruments become operational and when wavelength and bandpass
information becomes available.  These convolved data files, as well as
specpr command files for convolving the database to your own instruments,
will be made available on the spectroscopy lab web site <A
target="_blank" HREF="http://speclab.cr.usgs.gov/spectral-lib.html">
(http://speclab.cr.usgs.gov/spectral-lib.html) </A> and in the anonymous
ftp directory.  Each convolved instrument library will be provided in
both binary specpr and ascii formats.

<P>
A successful spectral library has extensive sample documentation.
We are indebted to J. S. Huebner and Judy Konnert of the USGS for
their support in analyzing the X-ray diffraction data on minerals for
the last couple of years in the splib04 library (Clark and others, 1993),
from which part of this library was derived.  We thank the late Norma
Vergo for many of the earlier X-ray analyses.  Norma's attention to
detail has certainly made this spectral library a quality product, and
we miss her.  Without these dedicated people providing superb analysis
and feedback, this library would not have been possible.


<P>
Of course, a spectral library needs quality samples.  We are indebted to
Charlie Alpers, Jim Crowley, Skip Cunningham, Jim Post, Fred Kruse, Jim
Post, Jack Salisbury, Richard V. Morris, and Roger Stoffregen for
donating excellent samples.  Thanks to the British Museum and the
National Museum of Natural History for mineral samples.  We thank Trude
King, Brad Dalton, and Barnaby Rockwell for contributing some samples
and spectra.  We thank Robert McDougal for help in reducing spectral
data on the artificial samples and early examinations of lists of
spectra to be included.


<P>	This project has been funded by the USGS Minerals Program,
the NASA Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer Team
(R. Clark, Co-I), and the NASA Cassini VIMS Team (R. Clark, Team Member).
